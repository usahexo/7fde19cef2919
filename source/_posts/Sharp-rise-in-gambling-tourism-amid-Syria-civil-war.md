#  Sharp rise in gambling tourism amid Syria civil war

As the Syrian civil war rages on, displacement of citizens is on the rise. More than four million Syrians have now fled their homes, seeking refuge in neighboring countries or further afield.

One of the unintended consequences of this humanitarian crisis is a sharp rise in gambling tourism. Syrians desperate for any form of escape are risking their money in illegal casino and gambling dens.

In Damascus, once a lively and popular destination for gamblers, traditional stone-walled casinos have all but disappeared. They have been replaced by clandestine operations, often run out of people's homes.

Most of the customers at these dens are middle-class Syrians who have lost everything in the civil war. Some are even borrowing money from friends and family members in order to gamble.

"I have lost so much money in the past year," said one regular gambler who wished to remain anonymous. "But I can't help coming back here. It's become an addiction."

The Assad regime has tried to crack down on gambling, but with limited success. The police occasionally raid casinos and gambling dens, but with so many operating illegally, they are unable to shut them all down.

The influx of Syrian gamblers is causing concern among neighboring countries already struggling to cope with the refugee crisis. In Jordan, which has taken in more than 1.5 million Syrians, authorities are working to close down illegal casinos.

"We don't want this kind of activity in our country," said a Jordanian government spokesperson. "It's bad for our economy and it's bad for our society."

#  Blackjack becomes Syria's new pastime

Since the eruption of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, various forms of entertainment have taken a backseat to the more pressing matter at hand. However, blackjack has seen a resurgence in popularity due to its simplicity and fast-paced gameplay.

Players can find blackjack tables at almost any casino across Syria, with betting minimums starting as low as 10 Syrian pounds. And while some may consider gambling a wasteful endeavor in times of hardship, many see it as a way to take their minds off of things for a few hours.

"I come here to forget about all my problems," said one regular at the Casino du Liban in Damascus. "It's nice to be able to escape for a while."

Blackjack is not the only form of gambling that has seen a resurgence in Syria; poker is also popular among fans of the game. In fact, there was even an amateur poker tournament held recently in Aleppo that drew players from all over the country.

With the civil war still raging on after seven years, it is unclear how much longer blackjack and poker will remain popular pastimes in Syria. But for now, they provide a much-needed respite from the daily realities of war-torn life.

#  How to win at blackjack in Syria

Casinos have been a favorite pastime of the wealthy and powerful since they were first introduced in Syria. Blackjack, in particular, is a game that can be enjoyed by players of all levels of experience and expertise. However, if you want to make sure that you come out on top when playing blackjack in Syria, there are a few strategies that you should follow.

The first step is to learn the basic rules of blackjack. This may seem like an obvious suggestion, but many players do not bother to learn the basics before they start playing. As a result, they quickly find themselves at a disadvantage. The second step is to practice your skills. Again, this may seem like common sense, but many players do not take the time to practice before playing for real money. If you want to have any chance of winning at blackjack in Syria, you need to be proficient with the basic strategy and with card counting.

Once you feel comfortable with the game itself, it’s time to start focusing on your betting strategy. In general, you want to bet conservatively when playing blackjack in Syria – especially when playing against the house edge. This means avoiding risky bets such as betting on black or red at roulette, or betting on a single number at craps. Instead, stick to safer bets such as betting on even or odd numbers, or betting on low or high numbers.

When it comes to blackjack specifically, there are two main strategies that you can use: basic strategy and card counting. Basic strategy is based on careful analysis of the odds and is designed to give players the best possible chance of winning without relying on complicated calculations or guesswork. Card counting, on the other hand, relies on keeping track of which cards have been played so that players can adjust their bets accordingly. This approach can be more complex than basic strategy, but it also offers the potential for larger profits if done correctly.

If you want to win at blackjack in Syria, it’s important to choose a game that fits your skill level and your betting strategy. With a bit of practice and some sound advice, you can be on your way to becoming a blackjack champion!

#  Casinos thriving as card counting becomes popular in Syria




Casinos are flourishing as the card counting game becomes popular in Syria. The game, which is said to have originated from the United States, has quickly gained a following in the war-torn country.

Die-hard casino fans believe that card counting gives them an edge over the house. This is because casinos typically alter the odds of games after big wins, making it more difficult for players to win in the long run. Card counters, however, keep track of which cards have been played so they can make better decisions about when to bet and how much.

While card counting is not technically illegal, casino operators don’t take kindly to players who employ this strategy. In some cases, they may ask players to leave or even call security. So far, there have been no reports of anyone being arrested for counting cards in Syria.

Despite the risks involved, more and more people are trying their hand at card counting. Some experts believe that the game could soon become as popular in Syria as it is in other parts of the world.

#  Blackjack: The Syrian way to gamble and win

Syria is a country that is well-known for its interesting past and culture. But what many people don’t know is that Syria is also a great place to gamble. There are numerous casinos throughout the country, each with its own unique style of games. Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in Syria, and there are a number of ways to play it that can give you an advantage over the house.

The classic version of blackjack is played with two decks of cards. The player and the dealer are both dealt two cards, and the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. Face cards (jacks, queens, and kings) are worth 10 points each, and an ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points. If the player has a total of 21 points (such as an ace and a ten), they win immediately. Otherwise, the player has the option of taking another card or standing pat (not taking any more cards). The dealer must always draw another card if their total is 16 or less, and must stand on 17 or more.

One way to give yourself an advantage in blackjack is to use what’s known as the “double down” strategy. This involves doubling your bet after seeing your first two cards, but then you can only take one more card. So if you have two weak cards (especially an ace and a two), doubling down can be a good way to increase your chances of winning without risking too much money.

Another strategy that can help you win at blackjack is called “insurance”. When the dealer shows an ace face up, you have the option of taking insurance against the possibility that they may have a blackjack (a total of 21). If you take insurance and the dealer does have a blackjack, then you lose your original bet but win twice your insurance bet. However, if the dealer doesn’t have blackjack, then you lose your insurance bet and still have to pay your normal bet. So whether or not you should take insurance depends on whether you think the dealer has a blackjack or not.
