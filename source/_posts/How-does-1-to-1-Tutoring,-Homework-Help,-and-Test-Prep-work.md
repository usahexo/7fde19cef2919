When it comes to supplemental education for your student, how much money are you looking to spend? While the cost of tutoring and homework help can vary greatly depending on what services you need, we can give you a general idea of what to expect.

Generally speaking, private 1-to-1 tutoring costs between $40 and $80 per hour. If you need help with homework, that service will generally cost between $25 and $50 per hour. Test preparation can be a little more expensive, with rates ranging from $35 to $75 per hour.

Keep in mind that these prices are just a general guideline. The actual cost of supplemental education services may be higher or lower depending on your location, the tutor’s experience, and the type of program you choose.

#  When is the best time to sign up for 1-to-1 Tutoring, Homework Help, and Test Prep?

Many parents ask us when the best time to sign up for 1-to-1 tutoring, homework help, and test prep is. The answer to this question depends on your child’s needs and how much time you want to commit.

If you want your child to get the most out of their 1-to-1 tutor, we recommend signing up before school starts. This way, your child can get ahead in their classes and build a strong foundation from the beginning.

For homework help and test prep, we recommend signing up at least a month before your child’s upcoming tests or exams. This will give our tutors enough time to create a personalized plan for your child.
