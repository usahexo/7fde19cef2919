#  How do I place a bet?

Placing a bet is a very simple process. Here are the steps:

1. Choose a sport and event you would like to bet on.

2. Choose the amount of money you would like to bet.

3. Choose the type of bet you would like to place.

4. Enter your information into the betting form and submit your bet!

Now that you know how to place a bet, let's take a look at the different types of bets available: 

  Point Spread Betting: A point spread is used in sports such as football and basketball. The point spread is a number assigned to a team by the bookmaker that represents the margin of victory they need to win by in order to cover the spread. For example, if Team A is playing Team B and the point spread is -7, Team A must win by more than 7 points for bets on them to pay out. If they only win by 6 points, then Team B would cover the spread and bets on Team A would lose.

 
Betting Against The Spread: As the name suggests, this type of betting is simply betting against the point spread instead of for it. So in our example above, if you thought Team B would beat Team A by more than 7 points, you would bet on them in this scenario. 

  Money Line Betting: A money line bet doesn’t involve a point spread at all – it’s simply who will win or lose the game outright. So in our example, if you thought Team A would beat Team B, you would bet on them using the money line odds which represent how much you stand to win on that particular wager. 

  Over/Under Betting: Also known as totals betting, over/under betting is when you predict whether the total number of points scored in a game will be over or under a particular number set by the bookmaker. So for example, if O/U 45 is set for two teams playing each other, then an over wager would be placed if you think that more than 45 points will be scored in total and vice versa for an under wager . 

  Parlay Betting: Parlay betting is quite simply when you combine two or more bets into one single wager with increased odds . This can be done multiple ways (e .g . 2x double , 3 fold , 4 fold etc.), but all selections must win for your parlay to payout . This can be a great way to make some serious profits if your predictions are accurate!
