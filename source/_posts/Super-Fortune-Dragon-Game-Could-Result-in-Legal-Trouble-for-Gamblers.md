#  Super Fortune Dragon Game Could Result in Legal Trouble for Gamblers

The online Super Fortune Dragon game from casino operator LeoVegas may end up causing legal problems for some of its players. This is because the game has been found to be very similar to the slot machine game known as “Dragon’s Fortune”, which is currently the subject of a court case in Sweden.

In that case, the game’s developer, Play’n GO, is being sued by a player who alleges that he lost SEK 1 million (around $117,000) due to manipulation of the game’s odds. The player claims that since Dragon’s Fortune is based on a random number generator (RNG), it is not possible to win or lose money by chance alone, and that the odds are instead manipulated in order to ensure that the house always wins.

Play’n GO denies these allegations, and has filed a counter-suit against the Swedish state gaming board Svenska Spel. The company argues that Svenska Spel should not be allowed to offer the game in Sweden due to its alleged unfairness. However, so far no ruling has been made on the case, and it is still ongoing.

Given this backdrop, it is perhaps not surprising that LeoVegas has chosen to quietly remove Super Fortune Dragon from its website. The game had been available since September 2017, but was taken down in March of this year following complaints from players about its similarity to Dragon’s Fortune.

It is unclear whether LeoVegas will face any legal action over Super Fortune Dragon, but it seems likely that at least some of its players will do so in light of the similarities between the two games.
