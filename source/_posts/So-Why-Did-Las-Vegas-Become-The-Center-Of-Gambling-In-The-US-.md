#  So Why Did Las Vegas Become The Center Of Gambling In The US? 

The city of Las Vegas has always been a place where people have gone to seek out fortune and pleasure. It is in the middle of the desert and there is something about the bright lights and excitement that keeps people coming back. However, it was not always known for gambling. In fact, when gambling was first legalized in Nevada in 1931, it was actually in Reno, which is about 250 miles north of Las Vegas. 

So why did Las Vegas eventually become the gambling capital of the US? There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, Las Vegas had a lot more to offer than just gambling.

This gave Las Vegas a chance to take over as the top gambling destination in the country.
