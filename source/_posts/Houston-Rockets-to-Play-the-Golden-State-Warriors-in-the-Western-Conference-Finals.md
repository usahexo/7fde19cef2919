#  Houston Rockets to Play the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference Finals

The Houston Rockets have won their way into the Western Conference Finals to play the Golden State Warriors. The Rockets upset the top seed in the West, the Oklahoma City Thunder, in five games. They will now have to face a team that is favored to win the NBA championship.

Houston is a No. 2 seed, but they are not given much of a chance against Golden State. The Warriors are led by Stephen Curry, who may be the best player in the league right now. He averaged over 30 points per game during the regular season and has continued that pace in the playoffs. Klay Thompson and Draymond Green are also major contributors for Golden State.

Houston does have some dangerous players of their own. James Harden is one of them. He averaged 27 points per game during the regular season and has been even better in the playoffs. Dwight Howard is also a force inside for Houston and can score on anyone.

This should be an exciting series to watch. It is definitely one that most people expect Golden State to win, but don’t count out Houston just yet. They proved that they can compete with anyone by beating Oklahoma City and they will definitely give Golden State a run for their money.

#  Houston Rockets' James Harden Named MVP

Houston Rockets' James Harden has been named MVP of the NBA. This is a well-deserved honor for one of the league's most dominant players.

Harden averaged 30.4 points, 8.8 assists, and 5.4 rebounds per game this season. He was also a force on defense, averaging 1.7 blocks and 1.5 steals per game.

Despite being injured for part of the season, Harden led the Rockets to a record of 65-17 and the number one seed in the Western Conference playoffs.

Harden is the third player in Rockets history to be named MVP, joining Moses Malone and Hakeem Olajuwon. He is also only the fourth player in NBA history to average at least 30 points, 8 assists, and 5 rebounds in a season, joining Oscar Robertson, Russell Westbrook, and LeBron James.

Harden has emerged as one of the most lethal offensive players in NBA history. He is an unguardable scorer who can create shots for himself and his teammates. He is also a tenacious defender who can lockdown opposing guards.

The Rockets are faced with a tough matchup against the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference Finals. However, with Harden leading the way, they have a chance to upset the defending champs and reach the NBA Finals.

#  Blackjack Split Tens: What is Houston Rockets? 

Houston Rockets is a professional basketball team in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Rockets are based in Houston, Texas, and play their home games at the Toyota Center. The team was established in 1967 as the San Diego Rockets, an expansion team of the NBA. In 1971, the Rockets moved to Houston. They were known as the "Rockets" from 1972 to 1997, when then-owner Les Alexander changed the team's name to reflect Houston's role in space exploration. The Rockets won two championships in 1994 and 1995.

The Rockets reached the NBA Finals in 1986 but were defeated by the Boston Celtics. In 1993, they lost in the Western Conference Finals to Phoenix Suns. After Alexander bought the team, the Rockets went on to win consecutive titles in 1994 and 1995 with solid players such as Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler. However, following Drexler's departure, Houston had a drought of playoff appearances until 2009. 

The current head coach of the Rockets is Mike D'Antoni and James Harden is their current star player.

#  Golden State Warriors vs Houston Rockets

The Golden State Warriors are set to take on the Houston Rockets in the Western Conference Finals. The Warriors have been dominant this season, and are looking to repeat as champions. However, the Rockets will be a tough opponent, as they have one of the best players in the league in James Harden.

The Warriors won the first two games of the series fairly easily, but the Rockets bounced back with a win in Game 3. The Rockets will need to win at least one more game if they want to make it to the NBA Finals.

Houston has some good players aside from Harden, including Chris Paul and Clint Capela. However, they may not be able to match up against the Warriors' stars, Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant. The Warriors are also deep, with players like Klay Thompson and Draymond Green.

It should be an exciting series, and it is sure to be a close one. The Rockets will definitely give the Warriors a challenge, but Golden State is still likely to come out on top.
