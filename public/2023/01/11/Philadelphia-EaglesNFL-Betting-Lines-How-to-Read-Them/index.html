      		<h1 id="Philadelphia-EaglesNFL-Betting-Lines-How-to-Read-Them"><a href="#Philadelphia-EaglesNFL-Betting-Lines-How-to-Read-Them" class="headerlink" title="Philadelphia EaglesNFL Betting Lines: How to Read Them"></a>Philadelphia EaglesNFL Betting Lines: How to Read Them</h1><p>The Philadelphia Eagles is the team that is in the National Football League (NFL). They are from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This team has had a lot of great players over the years. One example is Chuck Bednarik who was a linebacker for the Eagles. He was known as one of the best players in NFL history.</p>
<p>The Eagles have also had some pretty good teams over the years. In 2010, they made it to the playoffs but were eventually eliminated by the Green Bay Packers. The next year, they made it all the way to the NFC Championship game but were once again defeated, this time by the New York Giants. Finally, in 2017, they won their first Super Bowl championship by defeating the New England Patriots 41-33.</p>
<p>The Eagles have a long and storied history, and their fans are some of the most passionate in all of sports. If you’re looking to bet on them, it’s important that you understand how to read NFL betting lines correctly. In this article, we’ll take a look at how to do just that.</p>
<p>There are three different types of NFL betting lines: point spreads, moneylines, and totals (or Over/Under bets). Let’s take a look at each one in turn.</p>
<p>Point Spreads</p>
<p>A point spread is essentially a handicap that’s given to one team in order to make the odds more even. For example, let’s say that the Eagles are playing against the Dallas Cowboys. The Cowboys might be favored by 7 points in this game. This means that if you bet on Dallas, they would have to win by 8 or more points for you to win your bet; if they won by 7 points or less, then you would lose your bet. On the other hand, if you bet on Philadelphia, they could lose by up to 7 points and you would still win your bet.</p>
<p>Moneylines</p>
<p>A moneyline is simply a bet where you are betting on which team will win outright without any point spread involved. So, in our example above, if you wanted to bet on Dallas straight-up without any handicap involved, then you would be betting on them using a moneyline instead of a point spread. The odds here would be different depending on which team was favored and which was underdog, but typically the favorite will have shorter odds than the underdog (meaning it will be harder to win your money back if you bet on them).</p>
<p>Totals (Over/Under) Bets</p>
<p>Finally, there are also totals or Over/Under bets which involve betting on whether or not a certain number of points will be scored in a game between both teams combined. For example, let’s say that Philly is playing Dallas again and this time the total has been set at 45 points. You could wager on whether or not 45 or more total points will be scored in this game (the Over), or whether or not 44 or fewer total points will be scored (the Under).</p>
<h1 id="Philadelphia-Eagles-at-3-Against-the-Spread"><a href="#Philadelphia-Eagles-at-3-Against-the-Spread" class="headerlink" title="Philadelphia Eagles at +3 Against the Spread"></a>Philadelphia Eagles at +3 Against the Spread</h1><p>The Philadelphia Eagles come into this matchup as 3 point underdogs, and for good reason. The Los Angeles Rams are one of the most high powered offenses in the NFL, and have looked very good through the first two weeks of the season. The Eagles, on the other hand, have struggled mightily on offense.</p>
<p>While it is unlikely that the Eagles will be able to keep up with the Rams offensively, they do have a chance to pull off the upset. The Rams defense has not been as good as expected so far this season, and they could be susceptible to a big play from Carson Wentz and the Eagles offense.</p>
<p>If Wentz can get into a rhythm early and make some big plays against the Rams defense, Philadelphia could definitely pull off the upset. I would recommend taking the Eagles at +3 against the spread in this matchup.</p>
<h1 id="NFL-Week-7-Philadelphia-Eagles-Live-Betting-Odds"><a href="#NFL-Week-7-Philadelphia-Eagles-Live-Betting-Odds" class="headerlink" title="NFL Week 7: Philadelphia Eagles Live Betting Odds"></a>NFL Week 7: Philadelphia Eagles Live Betting Odds</h1><p>The Philadelphia Eagles are looking to notch their fourth win in a row when they host the Carolina Panthers on Thursday night. The game is scheduled to start at 8:20 p.m. ET and will be televised on FOX.</p>
<p>According to the latest odds, the Eagles are -5.5 point favorites at home. The over/under is set at 44 points.</p>
<p>Philadelphia has been one of the best teams in the NFL this season, thanks in large part to their high-powered offense. Led by quarterback Carson Wentz, the Eagles are averaging 27.7 points per game, which ranks fourth in the league. They’ve also been efficient on offense, ranking third in passing yards (288.3 ypg) and fifth in total yards (417.0 ypg).</p>
<p>The Panthers have had a bit of a rough season so far and come into this game with just a 2-3 record. However, they did manage to pull off an upset win over the New York Giants last week and will be looking to do the same against Philadelphia on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Quarterback Cam Newton has been solid for Carolina this season, throwing for 1,788 yards and 11 touchdowns while also rushing for 271 yards and three touchdowns. He’ll certainly be a player to watch out for on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Based on these odds, it looks like there’s some value betting on the Eagles heading into Week 7. Philadelphia has been one of the best teams in the NFL this season and should be able to take care of business at home against Carolina.</p>
<h1 id="Philadelphia-Eagles-vs-Washington-Redskins-Betting-Line"><a href="#Philadelphia-Eagles-vs-Washington-Redskins-Betting-Line" class="headerlink" title="Philadelphia Eagles vs Washington Redskins: Betting Line"></a>Philadelphia Eagles vs Washington Redskins: Betting Line</h1><p>The Washington Redskins will host the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday Night Football in Week 1 of the 2017 NFL season. The Redskins are three-point favorites, and the over-under is set at 47.5.</p>
<p>Philadelphia enters the season with high expectations after going 7-9 last year. The Eagles have one of the league’s best rosters on paper and will be looking to make a playoff run this season. Washington, on the other hand, struggled last year and missed the playoffs with a 7-9 record. The Redskins have made some major changes this offseason, most notably firing head coach Jay Gruden and replacing him with former Baylor head coach Matt Nagy.</p>
<p>Washington is clearly the better team on paper, but they are not without their flaws. The Redskins lost two of their top wide receivers this offseason (Pierre Garcon and DeSean Jackson) and will be relying heavily on third-year receiver Josh Doctson. Philadelphia’s defense should be able to take advantage of Washington’s lack of depth at wide receiver and make life difficult for quarterback Case Keenum.</p>
<p>The Eagles also have a strong running game led by Jay Ajayi and Darren Sproles. Washington has had trouble against the run in recent years, so look for Philadelphia to try to establish their running game early in this matchup.</p>
<p>Overall, I think Washington is a fairly weak team heading into this matchup against an improved Philadelphia squad. I expect Philadelphia to win this game outright, and I would recommend betting on them if you get the chance.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Redskins-vs-Philadelphia-Eagles"><a href="#Washington-Redskins-vs-Philadelphia-Eagles" class="headerlink" title="Washington Redskins vs Philadelphia Eagles"></a>Washington Redskins vs Philadelphia Eagles</h1><p>The Washington Redskins will take on the Philadelphia Eagles in a matchup of NFC East rivals. This game is important for both teams, as the winner will have an early advantage in the division race.</p>
<p>The Redskins have been one of the most inconsistent teams in the NFL this season. They started the year with a win over the Arizona Cardinals, but have since lost four of their last six games. Quarterback Kirk Cousins has been up and down this season, throwing for 2,028 yards and 10 touchdowns, but also throwing eight interceptions. The running game has also been inconsistent, with rookie Matt Jones leading the way with 459 yards and three touchdowns. The defense has been solid this season, allowing just 21.3 points per game.</p>
<p>The Eagles have had a similarly inconsistent season, starting with a 3-0 record before losing four of their next six games. However, they have won their last two games against the New Orleans Saints and Miami Dolphins. Quarterback Sam Bradford has played well this season, throwing for 1,766 yards and 14 touchdowns. The running game has been led by DeMarco Murray, who has rushed for 609 yards and seven touchdowns. The defense has struggled this season, allowing an average of 27 points per game.</p>
<p>This should be a close game between two evenly matched teams. The Redskins have home-field advantage, but I think the Eagles will pull out the victory thanks to their better offense.</p>
