<p>Argentina was led by its star players Messi and Neymar. Messi, who has been at the center of some controversy lately, was outstanding against Ecuador and looked like his old self. Neymar had several opportunities to score but was unable to find the back of the net. However, he did provide some good service to his teammates and played well overall.</p>
<p>Ecuador was led by its captain Antonio Valencia. Valencia was very active on offense but was also responsible for helping to defend against Messi and Neymar. He had an excellent game overall and almost pulled off an upset victory over Argentina.</p>
