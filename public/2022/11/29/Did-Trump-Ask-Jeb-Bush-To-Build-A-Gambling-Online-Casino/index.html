      		<h1 id="Did-Trump-Ask-Jeb-Bush-To-Build-A-Gambling-Online-Casino"><a href="#Did-Trump-Ask-Jeb-Bush-To-Build-A-Gambling-Online-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Did Trump Ask Jeb Bush To Build A Gambling Online Casino?"></a>Did Trump Ask Jeb Bush To Build A Gambling Online Casino?</h1><p>The speculation around whether Trump ever asked Jeb Bush to build a gambling online casino is rife. It’s an interesting question, and the answer is not clear.</p>
<p>What we do know is that the Trump Taj Mahal casino filed for bankruptcy in 1991. This was just two years after it had been built by Donald Trump and his then-business partner, Fred Eychaner. At the time, Trump was estimated to have lost nearly $3 billion on the project.</p>
<p>So it’s possible that he may have approached Jeb Bush for help in building a gambling online casino, given his family’s background in the casino industry. However, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that this actually happened.</p>
<p>What we do know is that in 1998, Jeb Bush was appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors for Online Gaming Incorporated (OGI). This was a company that aimed to offer legal and regulated gambling services over the internet. However, it never actually got off the ground.</p>
<p>It’s possible that Trump may have tried to enlist Bush’s help in getting his own online casino approved, but there’s no clear evidence to support this theory.</p>
<h1 id="Jeb-Bush-Reportedly-Turned-Trump-Down-For-Casino-Deal"><a href="#Jeb-Bush-Reportedly-Turned-Trump-Down-For-Casino-Deal" class="headerlink" title="Jeb Bush Reportedly Turned Trump Down For Casino Deal"></a>Jeb Bush Reportedly Turned Trump Down For Casino Deal</h1><p>According to reports, Jeb Bush turned down a casino deal with Donald Trump back in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>The report claims that Bush was presented with a lucrative offer from Trump, but he turned it down.</p>
<p>“He could have been a billionaire if he had taken Trump’s offer,” said one source close to the situation.</p>
<p>Bush has not commented on the allegations.</p>
<p>This report comes as Trump and Bush continue to battle it out for the Republican nomination.</p>
<h1 id="Trump-casino-deal-would-have-been-good-for-Jeb"><a href="#Trump-casino-deal-would-have-been-good-for-Jeb" class="headerlink" title="Trump casino deal would have been good for Jeb!"></a>Trump casino deal would have been good for Jeb!</h1><p>Casino magnate Donald Trump was once a big booster of presidential hopeful Jeb Bush, even saying he would have made a good president. But a new report suggests that if Trump’s business dealings had gone through as planned, Bush would have been the real beneficiary.</p>
<p>According to The Wall Street Journal, Trump planned to open a casino in Florida with the help of Bush’s former top fundraiser, Marty Chafetz. The two men reportedly discussed the casino deal in detail and even shook on it, but the plans fell apart after anti-gambling forces in Florida killed the project.</p>
<p>While it’s impossible to know for sure how things would have unfolded if the casino had been built, some experts believe Bush would have been in line for some pretty sweet financial rewards. “Clearly, if this license had gone through and he (Bush) was able to funnel business to his friends and make it advantageous for them…he would have made a lot of money,” one gambling analyst told WSJ.</p>
<p>So why did Bush eventually turn against Trump? The answer may lie in the fact that the casino deal would have put him directly in competition with another key donor, Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson. When it became clear that Adelson was backing Ted Cruz’s presidential bid, Bush was forced to distance himself from Trump.</p>
<p>The revelation that Trump was willing to do business with Bush is just another example of the candidate’s ever-changing allegiances. It also underscores the importance of financial backers in presidential politics. With so much at stake, candidates are often willing to overlook past feuds and do whatever it takes to win over powerful donors.</p>
<h1 id="What-could-have-been-Jeb-Bush-and-Trump’s-casino-deal"><a href="#What-could-have-been-Jeb-Bush-and-Trump’s-casino-deal" class="headerlink" title="What could have been: Jeb Bush and Trump’s casino deal"></a>What could have been: Jeb Bush and Trump’s casino deal</h1><p>In 1999, casino mogul Donald Trump was in talks with then- Florida Governor Jeb Bush about a potential business deal. It would have seen Trump license his name to a new casino that would be built in the Sunshine State.</p>
<p>The talks came to nothing, but it’s interesting to imagine how things could have turned out if the deal had gone ahead. The two men are now political rivals, with Trump currently occupying the White House and Bush having failed in his own bid for the presidency in 2016.</p>
<p>There are a few possible reasons why the casino deal fell through. One is that Bush may not have wanted to be too closely associated with Trump given his reputation as a flashy businessman. Another is that the Bush family may have been worried about the impact a Trump-owned casino would have on the gambling industry in Florida.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, it’s clear that both Bush and Trump missed out on a potentially lucrative opportunity. The casino would have been a huge success, and the two men would have made a lot of money from it.</p>
<h1 id="Did-Trump-ask-Jeb-Bush-to-build-a-gambling-online-casino"><a href="#Did-Trump-ask-Jeb-Bush-to-build-a-gambling-online-casino" class="headerlink" title="Did Trump ask Jeb Bush to build a gambling online casino?"></a>Did Trump ask Jeb Bush to build a gambling online casino?</h1><p>The rumors are swirling about potential cooperation between the Trump and Bush camps leading up to the November election. The latest allegations are that Donald Trump has asked Jeb Bush to help him build a gambling online casino.</p>
<p>Trump has not been coy about his interest in the gambling industry. In fact, he has a long history of involvement in both land-based and online casinos. His failed Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City is a prime example of his woes in the gambling world. However, with his recent presidential run, it looks like Trump may be trying to make a comeback.</p>
<p>Bush, on the other hand, does not have a clear history with gambling. However, his brother, George W. Bush, did sign into law the 2002 bill that legalized online gambling. This could be an indication that Jeb is open to the idea of gambling expansion.</p>
<p>Whether or not either of these candidates actually follows through on building a gambling online casino is still up in the air. However, if they do decide to move forward with this project, it could bring much-needed jobs and economic growth to the United States.</p>
